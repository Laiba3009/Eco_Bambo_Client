    question: "What are Bamboo Wall Hangings Made Of? Are They Durable?",
    answer:
      "Our exquisite bamboo wall hangings are crafted from 100% natural, official bamboo and meticulously handcrafted by skilled artisans. To ensure exceptional durability and a long lifespan of 7â€“8 years, we treat the bamboo with a special chemical process involving Borax and Boric Oxide. This treatment not only strengthens the material but also makes it water-resistant and protects it from demokinesis (wear and tear). The final touch is a gleaming varnish that enhances its natural shine and provides an extra layer of weatherproofing.",

    question: "Are These Handmade Bamboo Pieces Waterproof and Safe for Outdoor Use?",
